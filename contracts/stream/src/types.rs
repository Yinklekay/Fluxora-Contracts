//! Type definitions for the Fluxora stream contract.
//!
//! This module defines the `Stream` persistent-storage struct and a small set
//! of supplementary event/pagination structs that must live in a dedicated
//! submodule (for Soroban `#[contracttype]` codegen determinism and so they
//! can be imported from sibling modules such as `accrual` or `storage`
//! without creating cycles).
//!
//! All other contract types — including `ContractError`, `DataKey` (with its
//! frozen 0–36 discriminants), `Config`, the event payloads, `PauseKind`,
//! `StreamKind`, `StreamStatus`, `CreateStreamParams`, and similar enums —
//! live at the crate root in `lib.rs`. The `DataKey` variant order is the
//! single source of truth for storage discriminant stability; do **not**
//! duplicate those definitions here.
//!
//! # Adding a new struct to this module
//!
//! Only place a struct here when (a) it needs `#[contracttype]` and (b) it is
//! referenced by more than one other file in `src/`, or (c) it must be
//! imported by a test crate that depends on a concrete type path. All other
//! types belong at the crate root.

///
/// ```text
/// Active ↔ Paused    (via pause_stream/resume_stream)
/// Active → Cancelled (via cancel_stream, terminal)
/// Paused → Cancelled (via cancel_stream, terminal)
/// Active → Completed (via withdraw when withdrawn_amount == deposit_amount, terminal)

/// ## Time-Terminal Behavior
