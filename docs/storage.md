# Storage Layout

Contract storage architecture, key design, TTL policies, and `DataKey` evolution rules for the Fluxora stream contract.

**Source of truth:** `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs` (`DataKey` enum, TTL constants, storage helpers)

> **Canonical discriminant reference:** For the frozen discriminant table (variants 0–14) and the full ABI stability contract, see [ABI_STABILITY.md § 2.4](./ABI_STABILITY.md#24-storage-key-discriminants). The table below tracks all variants including post-freeze additions; always cross-check against both this file and `ABI_STABILITY.md` when adding new variants.

## 1. DataKey Enum

All storage keys are defined in the `DataKey` enum:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Config,                    // Instance storage for global settings (admin/token).
    NextStreamId,              // Instance storage for the auto-incrementing ID counter.
    Stream(u64),               // Persistent storage for individual stream data (O(1) lookup).
    RecipientStreams(Address), // Persistent storage for recipient stream index (sorted by stream_id).
    GlobalEmergencyPaused,
    CreationPaused,
    GlobalPauseReason,
    GlobalPauseTimestamp,
    GlobalPauseAdmin,
    AutoClaimDestination(u64),
    NextTemplateId,
    ActiveTemplateCount,
    StreamTemplate(u64),
    OwnerTemplateIds(Address),
    TotalLiabilities,
    WithdrawNonce(Address),
    PauseState,
    ReentrancyLock,
    RecipientStreamPage(Address, u32),
    RecipientStreamPageCount(Address),
    PendingRecipientUpdate(u64),
    IdReservation(Address),
    MaxRatePerSecond,
    DelegatedWithdrawNonce(Address),
    LastPauseRecord(PauseKind),
    RotationHistory(u64),
    LastAccrualLedgerTimestamp,
    PausedStreamCount,
    TotalKeeperFeesPaid,
    AutoRenewEnabled(u64),
    MaxLookbackLedgers(u64),
    SenderStreams(Address),
    PendingStreamOffer(u64),
    RecipientPendingOffers(Address),
    PooledStreamShares(u64),
    PooledStreamWithdrawn(u64, Address),
    DelegatedCancelNonce(Address),
}
```

## 2. DataKey Evolution Policy

`DataKey` is a `#[contracttype]` enum. Soroban serialises enum variants by their **discriminant index** (0-based, declaration order). Changing the order of existing variants, or inserting a new variant anywhere other than the end, silently shifts all subsequent discriminants and makes every existing persistent storage entry unreadable on any live instance.

### Rules (must be followed on every PR that touches `DataKey`)

Persistent storage is used for individual stream records and per-recipient nonces:

| Key Pattern | Type | Description | Set By | Modified By |
|-------------|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `Stream(stream_id)` | `Stream` struct | Complete stream state including participants, amounts, timing, and status | `create_stream()` | `pause_stream()`, `resume_stream()`, `cancel_stream()`, `withdraw()` |
| `RecipientStreams(address)` | `Vec<u64>` | Sorted list of stream IDs for a recipient | `create_stream()` | `close_completed_stream()` |
| `WithdrawNonce(address)` | `u64` | Monotonically increasing nonce for delegated-withdraw replay protection | `delegated_withdraw()` (first call) | `delegated_withdraw()` (incremented on each successful withdrawal that moves tokens) |
1. **Never reorder** existing variants. The discriminant table above is immutable for the lifetime of any deployed instance.
2. **Never remove** a variant that has ever been written to a live network. Mark it `#[deprecated]` in a doc comment and stop writing to it; do not delete it.
3. **Always append** new variants at the end of the enum.
4. **Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` only when required by the public versioning policy.**
   Appending a new variant at the end preserves on-chain readability for existing
   entries, so it is storage-compatible for the contract itself even though
   off-chain storage readers must still update their decoders.
5. **Document the ledger** at which each new variant is first deployed so that migration tooling can determine which entries exist on a given instance.

### What counts as a breaking storage change

| Change | Breaking? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Reorder existing variants | Yes — corrupts all existing entries | Never do this |
| Insert variant in the middle | Yes — shifts discriminants | Never do this |
| Remove an existing variant | Yes — existing entries become orphaned | Deprecate instead |
| Change the value type of an existing variant | Yes — existing entries become undecodable | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` |
| Append a new variant at the end | No — existing entries unaffected | Update docs/tests; bump `CONTRACT_VERSION` only if another integrator-visible policy trigger applies |
| Change TTL constants | No — no effect on stored data | No version bump required |
| Change internal helper logic with identical external behaviour | No | No version bump required |

### CI enforcement

Every PR is checked by ``script/check_storage_layout_diff.py`` (wired into
``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` as the required ``storage-layout-diff`` job).
The script:

1. Parses the ``DataKey`` enum from both ``contracts/stream/src/lib.rs`` and
   ``contracts/factory/src/lib.rs`` at the PR head and the merge-base
   (``origin/main``).
2. Compares variants position-by-position (0-based discriminant).
3. **Fails** (exit 1) if any of the following occurred:
   - An existing variant was renamed (name changed at same index).
   - An existing variant was removed (fewer variants in head than base).
   - An existing variant's field shape changed (e.g. ``Stream(u64)`` →
     ``Stream(Address)``).
   - A new variant was inserted in the middle (pushes subsequent variants).
4. **Passes** (exit 0) for strictly-additive changes (new variants appended
   at the end after all original variants).

See the script's docstring for the full specification and security
assumptions.  This check is in addition to the Rust compile-time checks in
``contracts/stream/src/checksum.rs`` and the versioning module.

### Current compatibility behavior

The current release is backward-compatible with V5-seeded storage because the
storage layout is append-only and the V5 `Stream` struct ended before the
`memo: Option<Bytes>` tail field was introduced. In practice, this means:

- V5 `Stream`, `Config`, `NextStreamId`, `RecipientStreams`, and `TotalLiabilities`
    entries still decode on V9.
- V6+ keys remain absent on a V5-seeded instance until the newer code writes
    them; reads must return `None`, `false`, or zero-like defaults rather than
    panicking.
- Read-only calls do not backfill absent storage keys. The compatibility tests
    only treat explicit writes as state changes.
- There is no on-chain migration of V5 storage into V9 storage. The guarantee
    is read compatibility, not state rewriting.

### Regression surface

The storage-key compatibility suite treats the following as the regression
boundary for this release:

- `DataKey` discriminants 0–36 stay in declaration order.
- `Stream` fields 0–13 keep their current positions and `memo` remains the
    last field.
- `memo` must decode as `None` on older V5-seeded entries.
- Later keys such as `WithdrawNonce`, `PauseState`, and the V7/V8/V9 append-only
    keys must stay absent on a V5-seeded instance until explicitly written.
- Any new storage key must be appended, paired with a `CONTRACT_VERSION`
    review, and added to the compatibility test suite.

### Residual risks

- **No on-chain enforcement.** The rules above are enforced by code review and CI only. A developer who reorders variants will not get a compile error — the bug will only surface at runtime when existing entries are read back with the wrong type.
- **Off-chain indexers.** Any tool that reads Soroban storage entries directly (e.g., via RPC `getLedgerEntries`) must be updated whenever a new variant is added, even if it is append-only.
- **Discriminant stability across forks.** If a fork of this contract adds variants in a different order, its discriminant table will diverge. Always use the canonical table above as the reference.

## 3. Storage Types

### Instance storage

Used for contract-wide configuration and counters. Shared across all operations, low cardinality (3 keys), TTL extended on every entry-point call.

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `Config` | Token address and admin address. Immutable after `init` except for admin rotation via `set_admin`. |
| `NextStreamId` | Monotonically increasing stream ID counter. Never decremented. |
| `GlobalEmergencyPaused` | Emergency pause flag. `true` blocks all operational entrypoints. |
| `CreationPaused` | Soft creation pause flag. `true` blocks `create_stream` and `create_streams`. |

### Persistent storage

Used for per-stream data and per-recipient indexes. Grows linearly with stream count.

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `Stream(stream_id)` | Complete stream state: participants, amounts, timing, status, `cancelled_at`, and optional bounded `metadata: Option<Map<Bytes, Bytes>>`. One entry per stream. |
| `RecipientStreams(address)` | Sorted `Vec<u64>` of stream IDs where `address` is the recipient. Maintained in ascending order. |
| `AutoClaimDestination(stream_id)` | Recipient-chosen destination `Address` for permissionless auto-claim. Absent when not opted in. Removed by `revoke_auto_claim`. |

### Stream Metadata Storage & Footprint

- **Storage Container**: Embedded directly within the `Stream` struct under `DataKey::Stream(stream_id)`.
- **Field Type**: `Option<Map<soroban_sdk::Bytes, soroban_sdk::Bytes>>`.
- **Footprint Bounds**: Bounded by `MAX_METADATA_KEYS = 8`, `MAX_METADATA_KEY_BYTES = 32`, `MAX_METADATA_VALUE_BYTES = 128`, and `MAX_METADATA_BYTES = 512`.
- **Footprint Impact**:
  - `None`: Consumes 1 byte XDR variant header (`Option::None`).
  - `Some(map)`: Maximum persistent byte footprint overhead is capped at 512 bytes + map serialization overhead (~560 bytes total).
- **TTL Dynamics**: Refreshed automatically whenever `DataKey::Stream(stream_id)` TTL is bumped during stream reads (`load_stream`) or mutations (`save_stream`). Purged when `close_completed_stream` removes `DataKey::Stream(stream_id)`.

## 4. TTL Policy

### Constants

```rust
const INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD: u32 = 17_280;  // ~1 day at 5 s/ledger
const INSTANCE_BUMP_AMOUNT: u32       = 120_960;  // ~7 days
const PERSISTENT_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD: u32 = 17_280;
const PERSISTENT_BUMP_AMOUNT: u32       = 120_960;
````

### Instance TTL

Extended via `bump_instance_ttl()` on **every** entry-point that touches instance storage (including query entrypoints like `is_global_emergency_paused`, `is_creation_paused`, `get_pause_reason`, `get_max_rate_per_second`, `read_paused_stream_count`, and `read_total_keeper_fees_paid`). This ensures all global settings and metrics remain fresh and protected from expiration under active contract usage.

### Persistent TTL & Storage Reclamation

Extended on every `load_stream()` (read) and `save_stream()` (write), and on index updates (`load_recipient_streams`, `save_recipient_streams`, `load_sender_streams`, `save_sender_streams`).

- **Adaptive TTL Propagation**: When creating or updating streams, `add_stream_to_recipient_index` and `add_stream_to_sender_index` scale index key TTL to the stream's remaining lifetime via `compute_adaptive_ttl(now, end_time)`.
- **Empty Index Reclamation**: When a recipient or sender index, pending offer index, or template ID index becomes empty (`streams.is_empty()`), the contract explicitly removes the persistent storage key (`env.storage().persistent().remove(&key)`), reclaiming on-chain state while safely returning an empty `Vec` on future reads.

| Scenario                                         | TTL refreshed?                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Stream created                                   | Yes (`save_stream` + `save_recipient_streams` + `save_sender_streams` adaptive) |
| Stream read via `get_stream_state`               | Yes (`load_stream`)                            |
| Stream read via `calculate_accrued`              | Yes (`load_stream`)                            |
| Stream mutated (pause/resume/cancel/withdraw)    | Yes (`load_stream` + `save_stream`)            |
| Stream closed via `close_completed_stream`       | Entry removed; index key removed if empty     |
| Recipient index read via `get_recipient_streams` | Yes (if non-empty)                             |
| Sender index read via `get_sender_streams`       | Yes (if non-empty)                             |

### TTL implications for operators

- **Active streams**: TTL refreshed on any interaction.
- **Cancelled streams**: Remain in persistent storage until the recipient withdraws the frozen accrued amount. `close_completed_stream` and `close_cancelled_stream` are blocked while any claimable balance remains; only once the recipient has fully withdrawn the frozen accrued can a permissionless cleanup remove the entry. Operators must ensure recipients are notified to withdraw before TTL expiry.
- **Inactive streams**: May expire after ~7 days with zero interaction. Operators must ensure recipients are notified before TTL expiry.
- **Expired entries**: Cannot be recovered. Data is permanently lost.
- **Contract liveness**: Instance storage stays alive as long as any function is called at least once per 7 days.

## 6. Security Notes

- **Atomic operations**: All state changes are transactional. No partial updates are possible.
- **Key isolation**: Each stream has independent storage. No cross-stream interference.
- **CEI ordering**: State is always persisted (`save_stream`) before any external token transfer. See `docs/security.md`.
- **No stale reads**: TTL bumps on reads mean monitoring queries keep data fresh.
- **Admin rotation**: `set_admin` writes a new `Config` with the updated admin address. The token address is immutable.
- **ID Reservation Overwrite**: Currently, invoking `reserve_stream_ids` unconditionally overwrites any existing `DataKey::IdReservation(Address)` entry for the caller. The `NextStreamId` global counter accurately tracks the sum of all reserved blocks, meaning the previously reserved but unconsumed IDs are permanently leaked rather than double-allocated. Integrators must avoid creating a new reservation before fully consuming or reclaiming an existing one.

## 8. V5 Storage Layout (historical reference)

This section documents the storage layout as it existed in **CONTRACT_VERSION = 5**, before the V6 additions. It is the authoritative reference for:

Discriminants 0–14 are **permanently frozen**. No variant at these positions may ever be reordered, renamed, or removed on any instance that has processed at least one transaction.

### V5 Stream struct (14 fields, positional XDR encoding)

| Position | Field                     | Type           | Notes                                        |
| -------: | :------------------------ | :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
|        0 | `stream_id`               | `u64`          | Monotonically increasing, set at creation    |
|        1 | `sender`                  | `Address`      | Stream creator and controller                |
|        2 | `recipient`               | `Address`      | Token beneficiary                            |
|        3 | `deposit_amount`          | `i128`         | Total escrowed tokens                        |
|        4 | `rate_per_second`         | `i128`         | Streaming speed in raw token units/second    |

|        6 | `cliff_time`              | `u64`          | Ledger timestamp when withdrawals unlock     |
|        7 | `end_time`                | `u64`          | Ledger timestamp when accrual stops          |
|        8 | `withdrawn_amount`        | `i128`         | Cumulative tokens already withdrawn          |
|        9 | `status`                  | `StreamStatus` | `Active`, `Paused`, `Completed`, `Cancelled` |
|       10 | `cancelled_at`            | `Option<u64>`  | Set when status transitions to `Cancelled`   |
|       11 | `checkpointed_amount`     | `i128`         | Accrued tokens locked at last rate change    |
|       12 | `checkpointed_at`         | `u64`          | Timestamp of last rate change                |
|       13 | `withdraw_dust_threshold` | `i128`         | Minimum withdrawal amount (0 = no filter)    |

**No `memo` field in V5.** The V5 `Stream` struct has exactly 14 fields.

### V5 → V6 transition

V6 and later upgrades appended new `DataKey` variants (discriminants 15–28) and one new `Stream` field:

| Discriminant | Variant                             | Storage    | Value type   | Notes                                                      |
| -----------: | :---------------------------------- | :--------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
|           15 | `WithdrawNonce(Address)`            | Persistent | `u64`        | Per-recipient nonce; absent until first delegated-withdraw |
|           16 | `PauseState`                        | Instance   | `PauseState` | Unified pause state enum                                   |
|           17 | `ReentrancyLock`                    | Instance   | `bool`       | Reentrancy guard; absent when not held                     |
|           18 | `RecipientStreamPage(Address, u32)` | Persistent | `Vec<u64>`   | Paged recipient index (page → IDs)                         |
|           19 | `RecipientStreamPageCount(Address)` | Persistent | `u32`        | Number of pages in recipient's index                       |
|           20 | `PendingRecipientUpdate(u64)`       | Persistent | `Address`    | Pending recipient rotation proposal                        |
|           21 | `IdReservation(Address)`            | Persistent | `IdReservation`| Active ID reservation for a caller                       |
|           22 | `MaxRatePerSecond`                  | Instance   | `i128`       | Per-stream max rate cap                                    |
|           23 | `DelegatedWithdrawNonce(Address)`   | Persistent | `u64`        | Per-recipient nonce for delegated-withdraw                 |
|           24 | `LastPauseRecord(PauseKind)`        | Instance   | `PauseRecord`| Last pause record for stream or protocol                   |
|           25 | `RotationHistory(u64)`              | Persistent | `Vec<RotationEntry>` | Rotation history for recipient/sender changes      |
|           26 | `LastAccrualLedgerTimestamp`        | Instance   | `u64`        | Last ledger timestamp observed for accrual clock-regression|
|           27 | `PausedStreamCount`                 | Instance   | `u64`        | Protocol-wide count of streams currently in `StreamStatus::Paused` |
|           28 | `TotalKeeperFeesPaid`               | Instance   | `i128`       | Aggregate sum of all keeper fees paid out via `keeper_cancel` |

V6 `Stream` struct adds one field at the end:

| Position | Field  | Type            | Notes                                                                  |
| -------: | :----- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       14 | `memo` | `Option<Bytes>` | Optional indexer correlation memo (max 64 bytes); `None` in V5 entries |

### V6 → V7 transition

V7 appended eight new `DataKey` variants (discriminants 21–28) while preserving all prior discriminants 0–20:

| Discriminant | Variant | Storage type | Value type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | `IdReservation(Address)` | Persistent | `IdReservation` | Active caller ID reservation |
| 22 | `MaxRatePerSecond` | Instance | `i128` | Per-stream max rate cap |
| 23 | `DelegatedWithdrawNonce(Address)` | Persistent | `u64` | Per-recipient delegated withdraw nonce |
| 24 | `LastPauseRecord(PauseKind)` | Instance | `PauseRecord` | Last pause record for stream or protocol pause |
| 25 | `RotationHistory(u64)` | Persistent | `Vec<RotationEntry>` | Recipient/sender rotation audit trail |
| 26 | `LastAccrualLedgerTimestamp` | Instance | `u64` | Last ledger timestamp for accrual clock regression detection |
| 27 | `PausedStreamCount` | Instance | `u64` | Protocol-wide count of streams currently in `StreamStatus::Paused` |
| 28 | `TotalKeeperFeesPaid` | Instance | `i128` | Aggregate keeper fees paid via `keeper_cancel` |

Code-level invariant verification for all 37 variants is maintained in [`contracts/stream/src/checksum.rs`](../contracts/stream/src/checksum.rs).

### Forward-compatibility guarantee

All V5 persistent `Stream` entries remain decodable on a V6/V7 instance. Soroban XDR struct decoding is **positional and forward-compatible**: a V6/V7 decoder reading a V5-encoded struct decodes the first 14 fields correctly and treats the absent 15th field as `None` (for `Option<Bytes>`).

This guarantee holds **only** because:

1. `memo` is `Option`-typed — an absent field decodes as `None`, not a type error.
2. `memo` is appended as the last field — no positional shift occurs for fields 0–13.

A non-`Option` append or a mid-struct insertion would break V5 entries silently.

### Regression test coverage

The file `contracts/stream/tests/storage_key_compat.rs` encodes these invariants as executable tests:

## 9. ID Reservation Reclamation

Both reservation release entrypoints now share a unified reclamation helper (`release_reservation`) that reclaims tip-adjacent unused IDs:

### `release_id_reservation` (Voluntary)
- **Action**: Immediate, voluntary release of an active reservation by its owner.
- **Counter Behavior**: If the reservation is **tip-adjacent** (its allocated range ends exactly at the current `NextStreamId`) and **fully or partially unconsumed**, `NextStreamId` is rewound to the first unconsumed ID. If IDs beyond the reservation range were consumed (non-tip-adjacent), the reservation record is simply removed with no counter rewind.

### `reclaim_expired_id_reservation` (Post-Expiry)
- **Action**: Permissionless reclamation of a reservation that has passed its `expiry` timestamp.
- **Counter Behavior**: Same as `release_id_reservation` — if the expired reservation is **tip-adjacent** and **unconsumed**, `NextStreamId` is rewound to the first unconsumed ID.

### Security Assumptions (NatSpec / Doc-comment style)
- **Pre-expiry rejection**: Blocks denial-of-service (DoS) or front-running attacks where an attacker reclaims a user's reservation before they can publish their streams.
- **At-expiry & post-expiry success**: Ensures that if a holder abandons or loses access to their reservation, the counter space/storage is not permanently locked, maintaining contract liveness.
- **Tip-adjacent guard**: Counter rewind only occurs when `reservation_end == current_count`, meaning no streams exist beyond the reserved range. This prevents unsafe rewinds that would create ID collisions with already-created streams.
- **Consistent event shape**: Both paths emit the `res_rel` event with `(start_id, count, consumed, reclaimed)`, ensuring consistent indexer accounting regardless of which release path triggered the reclamation.

### Single source of truth for the storage helpers

The three IdReservation storage helpers have exactly one definition each, all in
[`contracts/stream/src/storage.rs`](../contracts/stream/src/storage.rs):

| Helper                          | Persistence action                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `load_id_reservation(env, caller)`  | Reads `DataKey::IdReservation(caller)` from persistent storage (no TTL bump on read).             |
| `save_id_reservation(env, caller, res)` | Writes the reservation and bumps its TTL by `PERSISTENT_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD` / `PERSISTENT_BUMP_AMOUNT`. |
| `remove_id_reservation(env, caller)` | Removes `DataKey::IdReservation(caller)` from persistent storage.                                    |

`contracts/stream/src/lib.rs` **imports** these from the `storage` module
(`use storage::{ load_id_reservation, next_stream_id_for, remove_id_reservation, save_id_reservation };`)
and calls through — it does **not** redefine them.

**Why this matters.** These functions previously existed as two identical copies
(one in `storage.rs`, one in `lib.rs`). Two independent copies of the same
persistence logic are a drift hazard: a future change to the TTL policy
(`extend_ttl` bump amounts) or the `DataKey` key shape applied to only one copy
would silently produce inconsistent persistence — reservations that expire early
or key under a shape the reader cannot find. Because `next_stream_id_for`
consumes reservations to assign stream IDs, a divergent copy could orphan
pre-allocated ID ranges or, in the worst case, contribute to stream-ID reuse.

**Regression guard.** The single-definition invariant is enforced two ways:

| Guard                                                                 | Where it runs                                    | What it checks                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id_reservation_helpers_defined_exactly_once` (`#[test]`)             | `cargo test` — CI **Test** job (hard gate)       | Each helper is defined (`fn <name>(`) exactly once across `contracts/stream/src/`, and in `storage.rs`. |
| `lib_rs_imports_id_reservation_helpers_from_storage` (`#[test]`)      | `cargo test` — CI **Test** job (hard gate)       | `lib.rs` keeps a `use storage::{ … }` import wiring the shared implementation into scope.       |
| "Guard against duplicate IdReservation storage helpers" (grep step)   | CI **Lint** job (hard gate)                      | Belt-and-suspenders: fails if any helper's `fn <name>(` count under `contracts/stream/src/` ≠ 1, even if the Rust tests are removed. |

Both live alongside the reservation behavior tests in
[`contracts/stream/tests/id_reservation.rs`](../contracts/stream/tests/id_reservation.rs);
the grep step is defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
